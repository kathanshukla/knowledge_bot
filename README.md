# knowledge_bot

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a Knowledge Bot using the Google PaLM (Pathways Language Model) API and MongoDB for efficient and intelligent question-answering. The bot is designed to assist users by answering queries related to various policies from LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) and SBI (State Bank of India). This is achieved through integrating advanced natural language processing capabilities with a robust backend for data storage and retrieval.

## Project Overview
The Knowledge Bot project leverages the power of language models, specifically the Google PaLM model, and a MongoDB database to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries. The bot is built using Streamlit for the user interface, LangChain for conversational AI capabilities, and MongoDB Atlas for vector search and data storage.

### Key Components
1. **Language Model Integration**:
   - Utilizes the Google PaLM API to generate responses.
   - Configures and invokes the `GoogleGenerativeAI` model for answering user questions.

2. **Data Storage and Retrieval**:
   - Uses MongoDB Atlas to store policy documents and perform vector-based searches.
   - Implements `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch` for efficient similarity-based document retrieval.

3. **Conversation Memory**:
   - Employs `ConversationBufferMemory` to maintain the context of the conversation.
   - Supports continuous and context-aware dialogue with users.

4. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Defines a prompt template to guide the language model in generating accurate responses based on the context and conversation history.

5. **User Interface**:
   - Built with Streamlit to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.
   - Allows users to input queries and view responses dynamically.

### Project Structure
- **main.py**:
  - Sets up the Streamlit interface and manages user interactions.
  - Configures API keys and initializes the language model and memory components.
  - Defines functions to get user input and generate responses using the language model.

- **database.py**:
  - Configures MongoDB client and sets up the connection.
  - Creates or connects to the MongoDB collection for storing policy documents.
  - Implements vector search for efficient document retrieval.

- **load.py**:
  - Loads PDF documents from a specified directory.
  - Splits documents into manageable chunks for efficient processing and storage.
  - Prepares text data for vector search indexing.

### Usage
- Launch the Streamlit application.
- Enter your queries in the provided text input.
- View the responses generated by the Knowledge Bot.
- Explore policy documents and details via the sidebar navigation.

### Future Enhancements
- Add support for more insurance companies and policies.
- Improve the conversation memory for more complex dialogues.
- Integrate additional data sources for a broader knowledge base.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements and visualizations.
